## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets while preserving as much variance as possible. Feature selection methods help in selecting the most relevant features from the data, improving model accuracy and reducing overfitting.

This project covers:
- Implementation of PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Various feature selection techniques
- Application of these techniques on sample datasets

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Vrajal99/IS733_PCAAnalysis_and_FeatureSelection.git
    cd IS733_PCAAnalysis_and_FeatureSelection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the PCA and feature selection scripts, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the PCA analysis script:
    ```sh
    python scripts/pca_analysis.py --input data/your_dataset.csv --output results/pca_output.csv
    ```
3. Run the feature selection script:
    ```sh
    python scripts/feature_selection.py --input data/your_dataset.csv --output results/selected_features.csv
    ```

For detailed usage instructions and options, refer to the docstrings in the respective scripts.
